# Yoga-Classifier-using-Fast-AI

In this file i tried to classify between yoga poses. I have uploaded a dataset in Kaggle and used it. I have export from Kaggle to GitHub

This file i have using Fast AI library to do quick classifier

Here we train the model with a image dataset of 5 different poses

1. Downdog
2. Goddess
3. Plank
4. Side Plank
5. Tree
6. Warrior

I have used confusion matrix from FastAI as error metric.



Note : I will be doing the project from scratch using PyTorch as well.
